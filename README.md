#Welcome to Document Annotation, Analysis and Enrichment in Qualitative Data Archives 

Description:

A tremendous body of data has been collected and archived in the social sciences by observing
or interviewing people regarding their behavior, work ethics, attitudes, beliefs, etc. These
Qualitative data are useful source for later secondary research. Qualitative data is particularly
important in the fields of research that deal with very complex social and cultural problems, and
in emerging areas of inquiry. Qualitative data sets are typically very large with multi-million
word data sets. It is important to store, search, retrieve and share these huge data of multiples
types like image, text etc. more freely and subject to secondary analysis by researchers using a
range of analytical methods. However, it is disappointing that this kind of analytical tools for
secondary analysis has been very limited, especially in the social sciences.

The goal of this project is to enable intelligent access to such qualitative data gathered within
diverse sociological studies regarding the workplace. The analysis of the content of social
sciences has been an important concern. This kind of analysis typically relies on coding of the
text, annotating or gives comments on the text, and this can limits the sizes of the corpora that
can be analyzed for secondary research. Such kind of analysis tool has been developed in this
project to help the social scientist to re-use the qualitative data for their secondary research.

The web application helps the researcher to analysis qualitative digital archive using quote, code, annotation, comments etc. so that it can re-use the important information for secondary research. 
This application developed by JSF, Primefaces, Hibernate, JavaScript, XML, JAXB, REST (Jersey/JAX-RS), Stanford CoreNLP, Netbeans IDE and MySQL. You can see the project here http://greymane.l3s.uni-hannover.de:8089/DocumentAnalysis/

This project later integrated with main Maven projecct using SVN and Eclipse IDE.
It is a part of "GuteArbeit" (https://www.l3s.de/gute-arbeit) project at L3S.
